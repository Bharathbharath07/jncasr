        <p>ETU has organised various science popularization programs both for school students and teachers and also
            workshops for teachers. The most popular programs that ETU has been successfully conducting for many years
            now are :</p>

        <li>POCE Program</li>
        <li>National Science Day</li>
        <li>Celebration of Chemistry</li>
        <li>Teacher's Program</li>
        <li>Learning Science</li>

        <p>All these programs are conducted at different places in the country. The unit has the distinction of Prof.
            C. N. R. Rao offering lectures at these programs. These programs are aimed at young students in different
            cities to promote and instill curiosity in science subjects. These programs have a large turnout of students
            and teachers as they have proved to be very popular both amongst teachers and students. ETU in association
            with different institutions across the country, has been conducting these programs where a large number of
            schools are encouraged to participate by sending students (of high school) along with their teachers.</p>

        <P>Special programs designed to the needs of the students from Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNVs), Parikrma,
            School Chandan (Laxmeshwar), and ‘Chetana’- an orientation program for the State SSLC toppers (girls) in
            collaboration with GOVT. of Karnataka are organized and conducted at the Hall of Science.</P>

            in science to give him/her a global view of the progress of science in service to society. </p>
        <p> unit is engaged in bringing out the Hindi version of all the four parts of 'learning Science' series as
            both CD-ROMs and books. </p>
        <p>One of the topics on which ETU has started work is Nanoscience & technology for school children. This will
            cover various components like technology, health and other aspects of Nanomaterials. </p>
        <p>ETU will be taking up the translation, development and production of the book `Understanding Chemistry' in
